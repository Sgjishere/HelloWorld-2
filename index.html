    Hello World!

  HTML is an abbreviation for: Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the way that a website tells a browser how to display the site. It uses elements in order to separate paragraphs from headings, these elements also tell the webisite what piece of text is which.

      I decided to take this class because I have been very interested in technology since I was very little. I am taking this class to see which direction I will choose for my college major, and to hopefully get ahead of the game. I currently am very interested in media or computer science so I hope this class will help me choose.
